Public Repository for CLAS12 Operations Documentation


Note, this is really for version control on the source
code (tex, docx, figs, etc) that results in a document.

If you don't want to use this git for your source code,
but just the final pdf, then just update your one pdf
document instead of storing multiple copies.  Else we'll
have a pretty bloated repo.
