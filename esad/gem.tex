\section{GEM Tracker}
The Gas Electron Multiplier (GEM) tracker consists of two pairs of large area 1.2 m√ó 0.6
m three layer ionization chambers. All four chambers will be powered by a single HV power
supply. The signals will be read out via HDMI cables between the on-board pre-amplifier
and digitizer boards and the MPD system located next to the detector. A gas mixture of
70\% Ar and 30\% CO$_2$ will be supplied continuously to the chamber.
\subsection{Hazards}
Hazards to personnel include the high voltage which biases the chamber, and the
low current which powers the readout electronics.
\subsection{Mitigations}
Hazards to personnel are mitigated by turning off HV and LV power before disconnecting cables or working on the chambers and internal electronics.
There are no exposed wiring that can be touched by personnel.
\subsection{Responsible personnel}
Individuals responsible for the system are:
